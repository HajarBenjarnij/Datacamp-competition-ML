It is an important consideration to estimate the age of the abalones when they go to market. Determining an abalone's age involves counting the number of rings in a cross-section of the shell through a microscope. Since this method is somewhat cumbersome and complex, you are interested in helping the farmers estimate the age of the abalone using its physical characteristics.

ðŸ’ª Competition challenge
Create a report that covers the following:

1- How does weight change with age for each of the three sex categories?

2- Can you estimate an abalone's age using its physical characteristics?

3- Investigate which variables are better predictors of age for abalones.
